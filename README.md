**We've been nominated for a Golden Kitty from Product Hunt for Chrome Extension of the Year! [Vote here!](https://www.producthunt.com/@goldenkittymeow/collections/2016-chrome-extension-of-the-year)**

**B.S. Detector** is a rejoinder to Mark Zuckerberg's dubious claims that Facebook is unable to substantively address the proliferation of fake news on its platform. A browser extension for both Chrome and Mozilla-based browsers, B.S. Detector searches all links on a given webpage for references to unreliable sources, checking against a manually compiled list of domains. It then provides visual warnings about the presence of questionable links or the browsing of questionable websites:

The B.S. Detector is powered by [OpenSources](http://opensources.co), a professionally curated list of unreliable or otherwise questionable sources. We no longer maintain our own dataset. Neither the B.S. Detector nor the Self Agency LLC assume liability for the accuracy of OpenSources' data. To suggest or dispute a site's inclusion, [file an issue with OpenSources](https://github.com/bigmclargehuge/opensources).

Example domain classifications (in flux) include:

-   **Fake News:** Sources that fabricate stories out of whole cloth with the intent of pranking the public.
-   **Satire:** Sources that provide humorous commentary on current events in the form of fake news.
-   **Extreme Bias:** Sources that traffic in political propaganda and gross distortions of fact.
-   **Conspiracy Theory:** Sources that are well-known promoters of kooky conspiracy theories.
-   **Rumor Mill:** Sources that traffic in rumors, innuendo, and unverified claims.
-   **State News:** Sources in repressive states operating under government sanction.
-   **Junk Science:** Sources that promote pseudoscience, metaphysics, naturalistic fallacies, and other scientifically dubious claims.
-   **Hate Group:** Sources that actively promote racism, misogyny, homophobia, and other forms of discrimination.
-   **Clickbait:** Sources that are aimed at generating online advertising revenue and rely on sensationalist headlines or eye-catching pictures.
-   **Proceed With Caution:** Sources that may be reliable but whose contents require further verification.

## Contributing

We welcome pull requests and community collaboration. Before contributing, please review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/bs-detector/bs-detector/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). You can chat with other community members in realtime on Gitter [here](https://gitter.im/bs-detector/).

Check out our [roadmap](https://github.com/bs-detector/bs-detector/projects) to see what we intend to integrate in future releases and to decide whether you'd like to help with one of those tasks, as they might be duplicative of new functionality you wish to propose. We don't want to squander your time or enthusiasm, so we recommend proposing new functionality in an issue or on Gitter before building something out we might not end up using. It will also provide you with an opportunity to hear from other community members who might help flesh out your ideas.

If you are planning to contribute, please work off and submit pull requests to the `dev` branch, which is the most current build. `master` is intended for public releases only and is usually several commits behind `dev`. Edit resources in `ext` and use `gulp build` to compile manually. Use `gulp watch` to compile automatically on file changes. The compiled, unpackaged extension will be in the `build` folder, which you can then load in your browser.
